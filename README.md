# ecs-game-engine

This was a pet project of mine from about 2014 - 2018.<br/>
This was an attempt to make a RPG game and engine kind of in one go using SFML.<br/>
It failed for obvious reasons (i.e. it eventually just got to be too much to handle).<br/>

## History

I started this project as a simple OOP rpg, of course that got unmanagebale as the project grew. 
After two iterations of that I stumbled across ECS (Entity Component System).
A more data structured approach to game engines (Ironically Unity uses this style now).
So the last 2-3 years of development was focused on this iteration. 
However, if the goal would have been a game engine alone maybe this project would have succeeded.
Now im continuing development of this game in Unity. The repo for that isn't public but anyone who wants more info on the current state of
the game can try my Discord server: https://discord.gg/8ARNmrz

## Retrospective

This project really needs a large refactor to take the engine specific code out of the game code.
